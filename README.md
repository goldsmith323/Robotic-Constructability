## Description
This script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for generating Pareto plots from a given dataset. It allows users to select columns for the X and Y axes and highlights points on the plot.

## Abstract
This research explores the inclusion of constructability metrics in early computational design exploration, focusing on how structures should be built with robots. It includes studies on robotic construction tasks, construction-aware design exploration, evaluation of constructability based on assembly sequences. The goal is to incorporate robotic constructability knowledge into early-stage design workflows to provide adaptable construction-related suggestions and guidance.
